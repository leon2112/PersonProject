This is a prototype of a java 8 based project in which I have created a class called Person and I basically pass the entire behvaiour or action to be performed as input to the method that finds out the person whose last name is starting with C and also print out all people part of the list. My main objective of this personal project is to demonstrate benefits of declarable and immutable code which is basically the main aspect of functional programming.
